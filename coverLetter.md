# Job Requirements 
## Leading Agile Teams: _2 years experience_  
**Scrum Master Role** 
> From Jan 2017 to Dec 2018, as the Scrum Master, I coached the product owner and the scrum team on ways to efficiently manage their work and stay focus on the goals and vision of the project. The transportation fuels reporting system (TFRS) project was unique in many ways:

* The formation of a new Agile team using innovative "sprint with us" procurement process as well as traditional hiring  
* Coordinated and setup a physical lab space for the team to work, and arranged for the purchase of equipment  
* Lead the transition between software development methodologies, from a traditional project management approach to following the agile principles and values 
* Learned about DevOps pipelines and cloud native technologies  
* Adopted new product management tools for backlog management and product roadmaps 
* Encouraged developers who had to learn new programming languages 
* During all of that time we were working in an open lab space under the constant microscope of executives who were touring the building every couple days  
* Even with all that overhead and all those pressures the product team was still able deliver a minimal viable product to production in under a year

**Product Owner Role**
> From Jan 2019 to present I had a similar experience to the previous two years where we also had to:  

* Start up a new team beginning with contract procurement of developers, and
* Build a high functioning team with contractors and some other recently hired full time staff.   

> Our mandate at the outset of the project was to look at a set of previously built common services and make it easy to onboard to them. This began a very exciting journey into how we can evolve and modernize existing applications to take advantage of the latest architectural principles such as:   

* DevOps  
* Cloud Platforms
* Open Source products
* Open APIs and microservices  

> During the past 22 months my team has created 14 code repositories with which we have done the following:    

* deployed an application to conduct automated onboarding of api access 
* launched two common components apis (email messaging and document generation) each with a stand alone showcase application 
* responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with a custom application for industrial sites to report their protocols 
* built a catalogue to explain all the services 
* piloted a dashboard solution to help with the IITD cost reduction strategy  
* piloted an system logging solution to help with the need to monitor the uptime and errors of services
* Soon to release the MVP of new government wide form designer and publishing service. 
* We have established a capacity to deploy changes rapidly, evident by the average number of pull requests merged over the past 18 months (783 pull requests in under 400 business days).  

## Delivering Digital Products and Managing Service Offerings:  _13 years experience_ 
* Between April 2007 and now I have worked in the following roles:
	* business analyst  
	* project manager   
	* business portfolio manager  
	* scrum master  
	* product owner
* The most recent eight of the last 13 years have been on projects work, and prior to that I was supporting the delivery of continuous improvement enhancements and break fixes for multiple business critical applications.

## Analysis of User Research and Continuous Improvement of Digital Services: _13 years experience_
> 9 years experience in the capacity of a business analyst which involved

* assessing the needs of users and 
* preparing documentation for the development team based on the analysis of requirements gathering

> 4 years experience is as a Scrum Team member and Product Owner role reviewing the user research prepared by the UX Researcher/Designer of the team. This involves the following:   

* Sitting in on UX feedback sessions  
* Collaborating with the UX researcher to interpret the feedback  
* Revise our previous hypotheses on how to achieve the product vision  
* Refactoring product roadmaps and product features based on new hypotheses  

## Digital Service experience using agile practices, open source, and cloud platforms: _4 to 6 years experience_
**Agile Practices:** _4 years experience_
* 2016 to current working full time on Agile Teams using the Scrum Framework
	* Oct 2016 to Dec 2018 in the Scrum Master role
	* Jan 2019 to current, in the Product Owner role
* Oct 2016 to current delivering monthly Agile Fundamentals courses

**Open Source:**  _6 years experience_
* 6 years experience using open source software to implement Line of Business solutions based on IITD architectural principles
* The recent 4 years in particular I have been on a software team that is managing its code on Github as Open Source Apache 2.0 licensed software
* A lot of our work involves the evaluation and selection of other open source libraries for the inclusion in our product solutions in order to achieve the required capabilities 
* The past 2 years on the Common Service Showcase Team I have been focused on determining what makes an open source common component easy to onboard to 
* We have established a set of core characteristics and a setup delivery channels which if provided for will give users the required flexibility to implement your open source code as easy as possible

**Cloud Platforms:**  _4 years experience_
* 4 years experience working with OpenShift project namespaces and developing with DevOps principles 
	* I lead my team in the planning of development and continuous improvement activities. This includes the adoption of cloud native architectural principles and microservice architectures
	* We follow the "infrastructure as code" design principles, and continually streamline our code integration and deployment processes leveraging automated delivery pipelines (Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery)
	* Other cloud hosted services we use include those which provide services to our team's product such as static code analysis, database backups, and uptime monitoring
	* Our code includes unit tests, api test, and functional user interface tests, all automated and where possible done following test driven development principles
	* We followed an API first approach in order to build in a way that enables us to adapt quickly to changing requirements

## Prioritization of work in planning based on user needs, costs, value delivered, and return on investment: _13 years experience_ 
**Traditional Project Management:**
* 9 years experience in traditional project management and business analysis conducting prioritization of issues based on business value, impact to operations, and cost estimates

**Agile Product Management:**
* 4 years experience creating product roadmaps linked to the overall product vision to deliver a solution based on user needs. I link the biweekly planning goals to the overall product vision. I revise the plans biweekly based on user feedback and adapt the plan to those changing requirements    
* 4 years experience tracking the effort of tasks and calculating the team velocity by which they complete work. Used those velocity statistics to plan future product delivery increments  
* 4 years experience (2 years and a scrum master and 2 years as a product owner) creating and prioritizing backlog items in the form of user stories linked to the value to delivery to users  
* Over the past 4 years working on Agile projects I have formally identified and tracks value metrics used to report out on project success and return on investment and maintain realtime dashboards of those performance metrics

## Managing complex projects with business transformations, strategic communications, and oversight of system integrators:  _8 years experience_
**Business Transformation:**  
* From 2012 to 2015 the Mines Project kicked on a business transformation that is continuing strong to this day. During my time on the project we built an application (Mines Information To Go) that introduced the utilization of tablets for inspectors and a way to have access to their systems information while offline at a mine. 
* For the Low Carbon Fuels branch between 2015 and 2018 I provided a leading role to introduce their business area to the principles of Agile in software development. I helped to coach and mentor 3 of their staff as they took on a business leadership role at various stages of the project.  Through this project the business established a new positive relationship with staff from the various Fuels Suppliers. They collaborated with us in the development of a product that their employers were previously lobbying against.
* Building off of the success of some of the work in the TFRS project I took on a role as Product Owner to focus on the evolution and modernization of Common Services in order to reduce the duplication of effort by software developers. This business transformation is one that involves demonstrating to other development teams the long term economic value of investing in common components for the developer community. The successes we are now seeing with our email service, with over a dozen other software teams reusing the product from all across government, is evident that the common service approach is a welcomed transformational change to how we go about the business of software development.

**Strategic Communications:**  
> From 2012 to present as a project lead I initiate strategic communications to understand the attitudes of staff, executives and users of the future product in order to plan out actions to take and information to curate and disseminate. I do this all for the purpose of achieving the overall strategic goal of the projects.   

* In the Mines Project I prepared a specific presentation to help another Executive Director to convey the vision of the project to its Sponsor, who immediately got it and responded with, "Ok, let's do that."  
* On the Common Service Showcase Team the majority of my communication involves planning ahead to identify stakeholders and partnerships I need to establish and leverage in order to achieve the vision of my project. Carrying out these communications often involves creative use of tools and communication channels. Some of these established relationships include:
	* Other teams who are building common components
	* Governance level sponsors and directors who influence the adoption and funding of what we are building
	* Business Portfolio Managers who have awareness of many existing products and connections to business areas
	* Innovators who are building disruptive technologies that we want to prepare for and leverage
	* Platform services who we rely on for foundational technology
	* Training and communications groups who provide an avenue for outreach and product awareness
	* Other corporate wide bodies or subject matter experts such as privacy and security professionals

**Oversight of System Integrators:**
> Since 2012 I have been in a lead role on complex IM/IT projects where there was a project sponsor and a level of financial governance which I was responsible to account to on behalf of the project team.   

* From 2012 to 2015 I was the Business Portfolio Manager for the Mines and Mineral Resources Automation and System Integration Project. 
* From 2016 to 2019 I was and Business Portfolio Manager, and then The Scrum Master for the Transportation Fuels Reporting System as it shifted from a traditional project management approach to an Agile approach. 
* Since 2019 I have been the Product Owner for the Common Services Showcase Team where I now consult with an agile leadership group who provide project oversight and funding approval. 

## Managing organizational change: _4 years experience_  
> Experience from Oct 2016 to current, implementing an agile culture within IITD.  I was one the of the very first few people to build an Agile Team, take on a new role as a Scrum Master and then a Product Owner and pilot working on software development in a way that was entirely new to Government. I have helped to promote this organizational change by facilitating monthly courses in Agile Fundamentals. I co-facilitated over 50 courses and trained hundreds of people.
