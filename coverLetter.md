# Areas of Experience

## Agile project or service design experience 
> I have 10 years experience coaching and mentoring the software product owners and development teams in the software development framework used in the organization. 
> 
> For all projects I have work on I have set up tools and techniques for the product owner to effectively manage their backlog of work including tracking status of done, priority, estimated effort, and assigned resources. For the past 6 months I have been coaching a Product Owner in an organizational environment where Scrum is not yet fully understood.
> 
> I have participated as a team member for a Lean project to redesign the service of the Correspondence Unit for Ministry of Environment.
> 
> I have participated as a team member in a series of Service Design workshops for the Future State Transformation of BC’s Mines Permitting Services.

## Practical experience in Agile software development methodologies
> While the SDLC standard that my organization previously subscribed to is Waterfall, I was trained in University in the benefits of the various Agile software development methodologies and would employ those theories, practices, and rules in the projects I led wherever possible. One area that we were able to operate in a more agile manner was while our systems were in maintenance mode and after the waterfall project had completed.   
>   
> Since 2007 I have had a role similar to that of a Scrum Master providing coaching and mentoring for development teams and their respective product owner (referred to as an application administrator). I have usually been assigned between 3 to 7 software products at one time. During this time I have participated both in a coaching role for the team as well as being a member of the development team, assisting in defining the contents of time-boxed release cycles. I have worked side by side developers as they reviewed their code. I have conducted various types of testing and created test plans for the items being developed. I have promoted feature driven development approaches in order to maximize the value of the development team. We have also employed the use of the MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’ts) approach as described in Dynamic Systems Development Method.   
>   
> I have always been an advocate for change in my organization and including experimenting with more agile and lightweight approaches to software development. One example was that I was the Chair of a lightweight development community of practice, to help government staff produce small desktop productivity applications with the help of a Development Team expert that we brought in on contract to do a few sprints with the government staff. These staff employees were given mentoring in the processes and tools required to create a solution in a short timeline. And the knowledge and instruction that we provided to each team was collected into a SharePoint site archive as a set of lessons that others could draw from.

## Experience coaching staff and project teams
> I have facilitated many project and scrum events for the development team as needed, and have encouraged them to be self-organizing and accountable for the work they deliver. I have supported the development team by resolving project impediments for the team through frequent interaction with the organization.
> 
> For the past year I have been leading and coaching a team of Business Portfolio Managers in the organization that is now adopting Scrum. This has included helping them understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.
>
> I have co-facilitated five Lego4Scrum workshops to begin training the organization in scrum and agile principles.

## Knowledge of web development, and UI best practices
> I have 10 years experience supporting and managing development teams in the creation of web applications. For my whole career I have been involved in collaborating with teams across government in regards to best practices for User Interface Design and Web Media solutions.  
> 
> Between 2009 and 2010 I was heavily involved Co-chairing the Web Media Community of Practice where we worked with the OCIO, GCPE and SSBC to facilitate cross government discussions about web development, innovation, and UI best practices.   
>  
> I am currently working in the Continuous Service Improvement Lab as a Scrum Master, collaborating with multiple teams across government in order to gain knowledge and share my experience with web development and UI best practices.  
>  
> While I do spend time researching options, and strategies for solutions, part of my knowledge comes from knowing who I can talk to for advice and direction on the options I come up with. I work closely with experts in many disciplines such as Data, Technical, Security and Enterprise Architecture.

## Knowledge of UX application development
> I have received training in Service Design, Lean, Behavior Driven Development and Prototyping. I have taken courses at UVic in human computer interaction and I have a minor is psychology where I studied those interactions in greater detail.  I created the roadmap for the Transportation Fuels Reporting project, which I am currently the Scrum Master for, and have incorporated all these aspect of UX application development into the plan.
>
> I have also worked closely with information architects in designing new systems and services, and understand the importance of the structure of the content of a system.
>
> I have facilitated workshops to develop User Personas and Value Proposition Canvas. I have developed paper prototypes to get rapid user feedback and I developed the subsequent high fidelity bootstrap mockups. 

## Proficient knowledge in scrum management practices and tools
> I have a basic understanding and proficiency in Extreme Programming, Lean, KanBan, Scrum, Behaviour Driven Development, and the implementation of a Continuous Deployment Pipeline (Automated build, deployment, testing, code review, vulnerability scan, schema inspection). I have received specific training or taken courses in all of these areas.   
>  
> I use Github daily to inspect the code that is being worked on by the development team. I use Trello and/or JIRA to manage the product backlog using KanBan.  In my current project we are preparing tests before beginning the development.  I am using Swagger to review the API and to have discussions about the API with stakeholders. I have experience using OpenShift to review the output of an automated build and to promote a build to TEST and PROD.   
>  
> I have a proficient understanding of the technology stack in use to support a system built with a React front end, REST API Client and Server, Django/Python back-end, and a Postgres database. I understand how the system deployment is managed in OpenShift, using Kubernetes pods to deploy a docker container of the application that is committed to GitHub.  I have a knowledge of the method of using Jenkins, Schema Spy, SonarQube, and NavUnit tools to conducts various components of automation as part of the deployment pipeline.   
>   
> I have developed a proficiency in Scrum and can coach and mentor the scrum team in how to conduct daily stand-ups. I can facilitate as needed the Sprint Planning, Review and Retrospective meetings. I will be able to coach the organization to promote the use of the Scrum Framework more broadly.

## Knowledge of project management principles
> I completed a Business Administration diploma and have taken three additional professional training courses in Project Management while working as a Business Analyst / Project Manager since 2007.  
>
> I have worked closely with a Project Management Office for the past 10 years and have an indepth knowledge of the Project Management Body of Knowledge.

## Strong knowledge of software development lifecycle (SDLC)
> Since 2007 I have held roles on multiple simultaneously running software development teams either as a Business Analyst, a Project Manager, or a Business Portfolio Manager. The between 2007 and 2012 the products being supported were mostly stable production systems that required regular maintenance releases and technology updates. These products allowed for more aspects similar to agile approaches to be used while managing the releases. In 2012 some larger projects were initiated which I was able to participate in from start to finish. The project I was assigned to followed the traditional waterfall approach. One of the systems from that project recently was deployed to Production after four and a half years.    
>   
> The past 10 years of experience has provide me with a good breadth of knowledge in every aspect of the Software Development Lifecycle.

## Consultation and influence management skills
> Since May 2006 I have had experience consulting with clients on how they can direct their IM/IT efforts. By utilizing Information System Plans and reviewing the technical health and business value of their systems I have had many opportunities to influence the business towards a successful outcome. 
>
> Currently there are many opportunities to have conversations with peers in my branch about Agile and Scrum and how they different from tradition approaches to software development. I have produced a Trello template for other in my branch to use. I have ran workshops to share how Agile and Scrum can be a benefit. 
>
>  As part of the development of Information Systems Plans, I meet with Executive to review their business focus, and to discuss the IM/IT needs along with the funding requirements of their branch from a broad perspective. I have to prepare business cases and make a case for why the project is important. I have assisted in long term planning by providing forecasting estimates used in Cabinet submissions for Capital money and have been consistently successful in achieving the desired goal.

## Cooperation and stakeholder relationships
> I have facilitated many forms communication and conflict resolution between business areas, government technical teams and the software maintenance vendor.
>
> Because I look for opportunities to form genuine and strategic partnerships, I have been able to cultivate a rich network of individuals across government who I trust and can count on, and I believe they feel the same about me. I have formed lasting friendships with many co-workers and I believe it is influenced by the gratitude I express to individuals and the effort I put into the work I do with them. 

## Managing teams of professionals
> since 2007 I have been leading many teams of professionals in the support and maintenance of software and in the development of new software applications. I have worked to ensure the team produced quality outcomes, and as needed I would have those challenging conversations with team members who were not meeting expectations. 
>
> In managing these teams I provided coaching and direction for the team to support their efforts to learn and follow the BC Government culture, standards and processes.
