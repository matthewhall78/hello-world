# Job Requirements 
## Leading the creation, improvement, and management of a wide variety of products and services: _10 years experience_  

**Sr. Director Role**  
> From Jan 2022 to Present, I began the design of the Common Components Program which will deliver products and services to all of Government:  

* I started in this position on January 24th and began the search for team members immediately. The first team members began working on Febrary 14th (five contractors). Through a social media campaign I ran, I found five staff. The first employee began working on March 7th and the fourth started on March 15th. One more offer letter was extended and is accepted.  
* On the Form Design and Submission team we have held product inception meetings and began the formation of a research plan, product vision, business model, team agreement and agile framework  
* I have began formalizing partnerships with other Forms teams in government
* I created a governance framework template to provide structure for how teams who share the need for a core capability like "form design and submission" will collaborate in an open source project model

**Product Owner Role**
> From Jan 2019 to Nov 2020 (Common Service Showcase Team)
> From Nov 2020 to Jan 2022 (Mines Digital Trust Team) 

* Similar to in my current role as Senior Director and in my previous role as Senior Scrum Master role, I also began in both of the above roles without a team in place and needed to build and guide new team members into becoming a high functioning team:  
	* Start up a new team beginning with contract procurement of developers
	* Initiate some staff competitions for employee roles on the team
	* Coach the team towards being a high functioning team

Our mandate at the outset of the project was to look at the common components built as part of the Natural Resources Permitting Project and make them easy to onboard to. This began a very exciting journey into how we can evolve and modernize existing applications to take advantage of the latest architectural principles such as:   

* DevOps  
* Cloud Platforms
* Open Source products
* Open APIs and microservices  

> During my 2 years in this role my team has created 14 code repositories with which we use to accomplish the following:    

* Deployed an application to conduct automated onboarding of api access 
* Launched two common components apis (email messaging and document generation) each with a stand alone showcase application
* The email service was using to send out all the emails for BC Covid-19 vaccine appointments
* Responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with a custom application for industrial sites to report their protocols 
* Built a catalogue to explain all the services 
* Piloted a dashboard solution with Metabase to help with the IITD cost reduction strategy  
* Piloted an system logging solution to help with the need to monitor the uptime and errors of services
* Released an MVP of a form design and submission service currently serving over 350 forms and 3050 users
* Using DevOps practices we made the cost of change very affordable, evident by the average number of pull requests merged over the past 18 months (783 pull requests in under 400 business days).  

**Scrum Master Role** 
> From Oct 2016 to Dec 2016 I created my own onboarding material to learn how to be a Scrum Master in the BC Gov. Since I was the first one I had no other options  
> From Jan 2017 to Dec 2018, as the Scrum Master, I coached the product owner and the scrum team on ways to efficiently manage their work and stay focused on the goals and vision of the project. The transportation fuels reporting system (TFRS) project was unique in many ways:   

* Formed a new Agile team using the innovative "sprint with us" procurement process   
* Coordinated and setup a physical lab space for the team to work, and made arrangments for the purchase of equipment   
* Lead the transition between software development methodologies, from a traditional project management approach to following the agile principles and values  
* Learned about DevOps pipelines and cloud native technologies   
* Adopted new product management tools for backlog management and product roadmaps  
* Encouraged developers who had to learn new programming languages  

> During all of that time we were working in an open lab space under the constant microscope of executives who were touring the building every couple days. Even with all that overhead and all those pressures the product team was still able deliver a minimal viable product to production in under a year.
