# Experience
 
## Product Owner:
### Information, Innovation & Technology Division, Strategic Initiatives and Business Transformation Branch, Development and Digital Services Section  

- Transportation Fuels Reporting System (Nov 2018)
	* (Acting) Product Owner for 1 month
- Document Management Onboarding Demo (Jan 2019) 
	* Product Owner for a 3 day hackathon with 12 individuals and created a Document Management application [DMOD](https://github.com/bcgov/csnr-dmod/wiki/) and described the results of the hackathon on the github wiki, [3 Day Hackathon Results](https://github.com/bcgov/csnr-dmod/wiki/3-day-Hackathon#results)   
- Common Service Showcase Team (Jan 2019 to Present)
	* **Leading Agile Teams**:
	*  from Jan 2017 to Dec 2018 I was in a lead role on an Agile Team. As the Scrum Master I was responsible to be a servant leader to the product owner and to the scrum team. The transportation fuels reporting system (TFRS) project began with the formation of a new team using brand new "sprint with us" procurement processes as well as traditional hiring, the need to acquire a physical space for the team to work, the purchasing of equipment, transitioning the software development approach from a traditional project management approach to using following the agile principles and values, learning about DevOps pipelines and cloud native technologies, developers learning new programming languages, adopting new product management tools for backlog management and product roadmaps, and doing so in an open lab space under the constant microscope of executives who were touring the building every couple days.  Even with all that overhead and all those pressures the product team was still able deliver a minimal viable product to production in under a year.
	* From Jan 2019 to present I had a similar experience to the previous two years where again I had to start up a new team beginning with contract procurement of developers and building a high functioning team together with some other recently hired full time staff.  Our mandate at the outset of the project was to look at a set of previous built common services and make it easy to onboard to them. This began a very exciting journey into how we can evolve and modernize existing applications to take advantage of the latest architectural principles such as DevOps, Cloud Platforms, Open Source products, and Open APIs and microservices.  During the past 18 months my team has create 14 code repositories with which we have deployed two common service applications, launched two common components apis each with a stand alone showcase application, responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with a custom application for industrial sites to report their protocols, built a catalogue to explain all the services, piloted a dashboard solution to help with the IITD cost reduction strategy, and piloted an system logging solution to help with the need to monitor the uptime and errors of services. We have established a capacity to deploy changes rapidly, evident by the average number of pull requests merged over the past 18 months (783 pull requests in under 400 business days).

	* The past 2 years on the Common Service Showcase Team I have been focused on determining what makes an open source common component easy to onboard to 
	* We have established a set of core characteristics and a setup delivery channels which if provided for will give users the required flexibility to implement your open source code as easy as possible

	**Digital Service experience using Cloud Platforms**:  
	* 4 years experience working with OpenShift project namespaces and developing with DevOps principles

Mines Information to Go what the application we built.
	* For the Low Carbon Fuels branch between 2015 and 2018 I provided a leading role to introduce their business area to the principles of Agile in software development. I helped to coach and mentor 3 of their staff as they took on a business leadership role at various stages of the project. 
	* Building of the success of some of the work in the TFRS project I took on a role as Product Owner to focus on the evolution and modernization of Common Services in order to reduce the duplication of effort by software developers. This business transformation is one that involves education teams on the long term economic value of investing in architectural technology patterns that provide reuse by other in the developer community. The successes we are now seeing with our email service, with over a dozen other software teams reusing the product from all across government, is evident that the common service approach is a welcomed transformation change to how we go about the business of software development.

	**Managing complex projects with strategic communications**: 8 years experience  
	*  From 2012 to present as a project lead I initiate strategic communications to understand the attitudes of staff, executives and users of the future product in order to plan out actions to take and information to curate and disseminate.
